Emagnet is a very powerful tool for it's purpose wich is to capture  email addresses and passwords from leaked databases uploaded on pastebin. It's almost impossible to find leaked passwords when they are out of list on pastebin.com. Either they have been deleted by pastebin's techs or the uploads is just one in the crowd. To be honest it's easier to find a needle in a haystack then find outdated uploads on pastebin with the data we want to collect. 

#### BBC NEWS: ["Pastebin: Running the site where hackers publicise their attacks"](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-17524822) 

- Emagnet is No.1 tool for fetch these leaks from pastebin

### A sample from 2019-11-13 when running emagnet with brute force mode on for spotify:
* The result is amazing, it have never ever been so easy to hack million of peoples accounts before!
* Run emagnet on your android device, just put your android device in your pocket and emagnet will hack the accounts for you - This preview is for spotify, but emagnet has support for more protocols and it will be more supported protocols in next upgrade.

### Sit back and relax and Emagnet will do the rest, watch the video below, this is for real!

# Reality

#### Below you can see an image that describes the reality, emagnet makes it easier than ever to get hold of leaked accounts. Emagnet does not violate any country's laws as long as you brute forcing your own accounts only (this is up to every user to decide), all we do is retrieve data from pastebin, if you have opinions or questions about stuff pastebin hosting you will find all info on https://pastebin.com/contact to get in touch - I wont reply questions about this in my mailbox, all kind of messages that contains such info will be wiped, just for your notice.

#### Please do not waste my time with _nonsence_, thanks.

### Notice

Attacking different kinds of accounts via emagnet that you have not been granted or allowed to attack is strictly prohibited and it breaks the law. The punishment is hard and you can even get into prison in some countries just for trying to attack for intrusion. With this said, it's *important* that all users is aware of this and when you have cloned or downloaded it's fully up to every user to take responsibility over their own actions. wuseman cannot be held responsible for the actions of any user, all users using Emagnet on their own responsibility. 

Developer: "All my previews where a brute force attack has been done is under controlling forms with 100% fully permissions by the owners. If you have any questions about this then you are welcome to contact me or the owner."

### Haters Gonna Hate

If you are one of these who dislikes _EMAGNET_ and believe the program has been developed for a reason that would break the law then I am not interested in taking part of your opinions, keep them for _yourself_! Emagnet does **NOT** leak any data at all either to the developer(s) or anyone else. No statistics at all to track any user so if you want to contact me for ask who it might was who downloaded emagnet a specific date is completely useless since i really have no idea, and to be honest I don't care.

Feel free to read the history about emagnet [here](https://github.com/wuseman/EMAGNET/wiki/About) and how everything started about this project.

#### Development of emagnet is active and is updated frequently, please use the latest version if you report issues/bugs.

# Greetings:

And to all ppl that is trying to sell public leaks and steal the real hackers job, f*ck you! This is one reason why I started this project, I hope this project will get widely spreaded so you will earn 0.00$ on your re-edited malware shit!

Cheers!
