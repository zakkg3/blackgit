##### Version 1.4 - BETA

-   I decided to split everything into small scripts instead since it's alot easier to troubleshoot if something goes wrong, you wont notice any difference at all, run 'emagnet' to execute them, 
    there is no  reason to run any of the scripts from .scripts dir, listing the new ones only:
    .scripts/emagnet-backup.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-banner.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-clone.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-f.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-help.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-hidden.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-main.sh
    .scripts/emagnet-mirror.sh

    .scripts/emagnet-spider.sh

-   Added .scripts/emagnet-ping.sh - Enter a dns and emagnet will check via downforjustyou website if host is up
    and for ipv4 number ip addressed emagnet gonna use '/bin/ping' instead for get a valid result very very fast if the ip-address is up or down.
-   It's now possible to use emagnet for upload from stdout from commandline, example usage: 'dmesg | emagnet -n'. Host does NOT store any ip number or other data about users at all.

-   .scripts/emagnet-f.sh is a loop script, there i no reason for touch this, run emagnet -f to execute it.
-   Now execute setup.sh to setup everything before you will run emagnet. There is no requirements for edit 
    /etc/emagnet.conf anymore, just run emagnet-setup.sh and then you will be able to run emagnet.
-   Debug mode has been enable, use debug mode with arg: -d 

##### Version: 1.2 - BETA

-   Fixed so we wont keep any duplicate.
-   Set your paths in /etc/emagnet.conf. There is no need for change stuff in 'emagnet' anymore.
-   Now emagnet store all files from pastebin so you can go through them later if you wanna find something offline without any stress..
-   More efficient logging to keep things sorted, all uploaded files that includes email addresses will be stored in it's own folder so it's easy to find passwords and mail addresses.
-   Added getopts, from now you must use -o, -h or -f to run emagnet.
-   Help section was added.
-   Paths need to be properly set in /etc/magnet.conf otherwise emagnet wont run (no more files in emagnet folder ;))
